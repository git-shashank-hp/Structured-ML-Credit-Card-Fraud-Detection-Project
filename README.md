# Structured-ML-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transaction details, including customer information, merchant details, and the transaction amount, labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to build an effective fraud detection system to minimize financial losses for banks and improve customer security.

# Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳🚨 

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transaction details, including customer information, merchant details, and the transaction amount, labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The goal is to build an effective fraud detection system to minimize financial losses for banks and improve customer security. 🛡️

## Workflow 🔄

1. **Data Collection 📊**:  
   - The dataset contains historical credit card transaction data with labeled fraudulent transactions.
   - Data is loaded and preprocessed for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍**:  
   - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand data distributions, correlations, and identify potential issues like missing values or skewed data.

3. **Data Preprocessing 🧹**:  
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and address class imbalance in the dataset.

4. **Model Building 🤖**:  
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to detect fraud.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

5. **Model Deployment 🚀**:  
   - Finalize the best performing model and prepare it for deployment in a real-world scenario.
